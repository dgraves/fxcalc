Windows:
Use the fxcalc project files (fxcalc.dsw) found in the win32 subdirectory to 
build fxcalc.  This will build both doubledouble and fxcalc.

UNIX and UNIX-like platforms:
Prior to building fxcalc you will need to build doubledouble.  At some
point the configure scripts will be modified to include doubledouble,
but for now you must manually edit the Makefile that comes with doubledouble
and build the library.  The doubledouble library can be found in the
doubledouble subdirectory. 

After building doubledouble:

To build and install fxcalc:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Top build without doubledouble, use the configure option:
  --disable-doubledouble
