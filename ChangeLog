Wun Mar 31 2002 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
 * Window is now resizeable.  
 * Fixed doubledouble pow related bugs in calc x^2 function.  
 * Fixed doubledouble pow related bugs in statistics box.  
 * doubledouble package was integrated with configure.  
 * Updated URL for FOX website.  

Tue Mar 29 2002 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
 * Updates for compatability with changes to FXList
 * Improved drag and drop in stat list
 * Fixed digit grouping bug with comma appearing after negative sign '-'

Sat Apr 7 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
 * Added context sensitive help to CALCStatBox and CALCDigitBox
 * Fixed clipboard code
 * Improved icons
 * Added fxcalc.ico for Windows
 * Fixed CALCStatBox to compile with MipsPRO
 * Fixed doubledouble makefile to compile with MipsPRO
 * Improved configure scripts

Mon Mar 5 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
 * Added pop-menu to display help on demand
 * Replaced floor calls with a truncate to deal with negative values properly
 * Bit operations were being done with an int rather than a 64-bit value
 * Added default button to digit box

Sun Mar 4 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
  * Added help text for stat box and digit box.
  * Modified check for input of 90 and 270 to tan again
    - Now takes an angle < 0 or > 360 and fixes it to be
	- within the 0-360 range.  This will catch all entries
	- of 90 and 270 for degrees or 100 and 300 for gradients.
	- It does not always work with radians because here we are
	- not testing for whole numbers.  So, if an angle fails the 
	- first test, it is put into to the cos function and
	- the result checked to be 0.  This also tends to fail 
	- in some situations, since most cos implementations
	- return a very small non-zero value for 90 (which is why tan(90)
	- produces a valid result on most systems).  I should probably
	- apply a threshold to the results of trig functions to attempt
	- to remove these small imprecisions.  
  * Added info for doubledouble to the about box.  
  * Added GNU GPL info to each file

Sat Mar 3 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
  * Added forgotten check for divide by zero with '%' operation
  * Fixed error checking for atanh
  * Modified check for input of 90 and 270 to tan
  * Fixed bug in doubledouble to int64 conversion
  * Fixed bug with 'int' button only truncating numbers that were entered directly and not results of other ops (eg cos)
  * Added dialog box to allow user to select the number of decimal digits to work with
  * Added 2PI.  Displayed wit inv+pi button combination
  * Added right shift.  Executed with the inv+lsh button combination
  * Added help text for calculator widgets
  * Added tooltip option to display help text for calculator widgets

Fri Mar 2 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
  * Added more error checking - new checks for input to log,ln,acos,asin
  * Work around for the problematic doubledouble pow function:
    - pow takes x^y and computes as y*log(x) such that x may not be <= 0.  So -4^2 generates an error with doubledouble
  * Added compilation option to limit mantissa length, because of precision issues mostly noticeable with trig functions

Thu Mar 1 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
  * Added support for doubledouble 128 bit floating point library
  * Added routines to convert 64 bit ints to doubledouble

Tue Feb 20 2001 Dustin Graves <dgraves@computer.org>
  * Mostly functional scientific calculator - v0.9.6
  * Implemented stat box functions
  * Added DND between calculator, stat box, and other DND supporting applications
