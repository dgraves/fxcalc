The version of the doubledouble library, which this program uses for 128-bit
floating point math, that is being distributed with this program is
slightly different from the official doubledouble distribution.  I 
have made som modifications to the source in order to make it compile 
with current versions of gcc, MIPSpro CC, and Visual C++ 6.0.
