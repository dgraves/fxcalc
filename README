This software contains code from version 2.2 of the`doubledouble' software 
package which implements doubled-double (approximately 30 decimal place) floating 
point arithmetic on IEEE 754 floating-point hardware.

The version of the doubledouble library (which this program uses for 128-bit
floating point math) distributed with this program differs from the 
official doubledouble distribution.  Some modifications to the source have been 
made in order to compile with current versions of gcc, MIPSpro CC, and Visual C++.  
A bug with the 'pow' function has also been fixed.  See ChangeLog for details.
